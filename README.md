# WhatRadio

Welcome to WhatRadio, the coolest internet radio experience designed for Raspberry Pi Zero 2. This isn't just a radio; it's your gateway to a world of music, powered by the slick [Pimoroni DAC](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pirate-audio-line-out?variant=31189750546515). Transform your Raspberry Pi into a music wizard, playing tunes from across the globe, and even recognizing songs like magic!

## Base Setup
To set up WhatRadio, 
1. Place the `build` directory in `/home/pi`
2. Rename the directory to `whatradio` e.g. `/home/pi/whatradio`
3. Run `sudo ./install.sh`

If you're running headless, `rsync` the folder to your Pi:
```
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local mkdir /home/pi/whatradio
rsync -avz build/ pi@raspberrypi.local:/home/pi/whatradio/
```

## Musical Sherlock: Song Recognition

```
export GOOS=linux
export GOARCH=arm
export GOARM=6  # Zero 2 would be `7`
```
2. OS: Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 64-bit)
